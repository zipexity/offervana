                      OfferVana is a multi offer platform that gives you the

                      and receive offers from all the major iBuyerâ€™s including
                      OpenDoor, OfferPad, Zillow Offers, and dozens of other
                      local investors who buy homes cash.

                      other iBuyers for your home. Many times we can find missed
                      upgrades, lot sizes, or better comps, to justify the
                      iBuyer coming up on their initial offer price.
